# Covid_Detection_From_X_Ray_Images

This is a repository that contains the code that I developed and datasets that I worked on for an In-Class Kaggle Competition as a part of a PhD level course in Deep Learning 
that I attended at the University of Waterloo. The challenge here is to identify whether or not a person has Covid based on a chest X-ray image. I have used the pre-trained
Efficientnet3 CNN of Google for training and prediction. This repository contains the following files: 

1. Dataset - Training and Test Images 
2. Jupyter Notebook that contains the code
3. train_labels.xls - Training Image names and their corresponding labels ( 0 for negative Covid Cases and 1 for positive Covid cases )
4. test_labels.xls -  Test Image names
5. sample_submission.xls - A file that contains a templete for submitting the responses
